# Animation

This application is the simplest example of animation for Labels.
Thus it is very useful in creating the launch view for your application. 
Many of the iOS applications prefers to have simple animation at the launch of app.

Here using 

+ (void)animateWithDuration:(NSTimeInterval)duration delay:(NSTimeInterval)delay options:(UIViewAnimationOptions)options animations:(void (^)(void))animations completion:(void (^ __nullable)(BOOL finished))completion NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(4_0);

method for animation.

/* Performs `animations` using a timing curve described by the motion of a spring. When `dampingRatio` is 1, the animation will smoothly decelerate to its final model values without oscillating. Damping ratios less than 1 will oscillate more and more before coming to a complete stop. You can use the initial spring velocity to specify how fast the object at the end of the simulated spring was moving before it was attached. It's a unit coordinate system, where 1 is defined as travelling the total animation distance in a second. So if you're changing an object's position by 200pt in this animation, and you want the animation to behave as if the object was moving at 100pt/s before the animation started, you'd pass 0.5. You'll typically want to pass 0 for the velocity. */
